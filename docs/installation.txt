============
Installation
============

docxgen requires at least Python 2.4 to work correctly though we
recommend upgrading to 2.5 or higher.  docxgen currently does not support
Python 3 and there are no direct plans on supporting it for the time
being.  If you wish to use docxgen on Python 3 please contact the
developers.


Installing a released version
=============================

As a Python egg (via easy_install or pip)
-----------------------------------------

You can install the most recent docxgen version using `easy_install`_::

    sudo easy_install docxgen

Alternatively you can also use pip::

    sudo pip install docxgen

Either way we strongly recommend using these tools in combination with
`virtualenv`_.

This will install a docxgen egg in your Python installation's `site-packages`
directory.

From the tarball release
-------------------------

1.  Download the most recent tarball from the `download page`_.
2.  Unpack the tarball.
3.  ``sudo python setup.py install``

Note that the last command will automatically download and install
`setuptools`_ if you don't already have it installed.  This requires a working
Internet connection.

This will install docxgen into your Python installation's `site-packages`
directory.


Installing the development version
==================================

1.  Install `Git`_
2.  ``git clone git://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug.git``
3.  ``cd werkzeug``
4.  ``ln -s werkzeug /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages``
